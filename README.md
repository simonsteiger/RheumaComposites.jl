[![Build Status](https://github.com/simonsteiger/RheumaComposites.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/simonsteiger/RheumaComposites.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This package implements the most common composite scores used for evaluating disease activity across different rheumatic diseases:

- DAS28ESR
- DAS28CRP

## Resources

Not much here yet!

There are currently only two constructors `DAS28ESR` and `DAS28CRP` with the `weight` and `score` methods implemented.
For now, please see the function help to learn more about their usage.

**NOTE**: This project is a very early work in progress and far from complete.
